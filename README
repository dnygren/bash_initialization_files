    Place these files in your home directory and make them readable by the user.
Read the comments in the files and the bash man page for more details on their
operation.

The current order of execution is:
~/.bash_profile calls ~/.bashrc when the former completes.
~/.bashrc calls calls ~/.bash_aliases and ~/.bash_functions at its start.
